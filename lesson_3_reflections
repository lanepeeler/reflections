When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all work local
    so you can get more collaborations on it. (?)


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Maybe a contributor has made changes on GitHub that 1) you are not
    familiarized with yet and/or 2) you don't want in your local
    directory. You would want to know of any changes made before adding
    them to your own local directory.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are for cloning someone's repository from GitHub into your GitHub
    account. This is so you can make your own changes to it without changing
    the original owner's. Clones are for making a copy of someone's repository
    to work with it in your local directory. Branches are for making changes
    when you want to add something new/experimental to a project that you
    don't know will work, and you expect it to fail/break/error, so you
    work on it separately from the working version.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

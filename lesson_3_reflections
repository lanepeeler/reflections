    You would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all work local
    so you can get more collaborations on it. (?)


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Maybe a contributor has made changes on GitHub that 1) you are not
    familiarized with yet and/or 2) you don't want in your local
    directory. You would want to know of any changes made before adding
    them to your own local directory.

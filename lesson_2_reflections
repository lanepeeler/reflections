What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git file is created in the repository. The period at the beginning
	hides it/its contents from the user since the user doesn't interact
	with those files very often or doesn't necessarily need to. We need
	to do this so that we can create commits/branches and start making
	tracked changes to the project.
